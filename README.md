📌 Project Summary

Title: Freelancer Time Management System (Java | JDBC | Servlet | JSP)

The Freelancer Time Management System is a Java-based web application developed to manage freelance projects, track billable working hours, and generate invoices efficiently. The system is built using Java Servlets and JSP for the web layer and JDBC for database connectivity, following a simplified MVC (Model–View–Controller) architecture.

The application allows freelancers to manage clients and projects, record time entries for different projects, and generate invoices based on total billable hours. Clients can log in to view project status and invoices. All persistent data is stored in a MySQL relational database, ensuring data consistency and reliability.

In this project, JSP pages are used for presenting the user interface, Servlets handle user requests and business logic, and DAO classes using JDBC perform CRUD operations on the database. This separation of concerns improves code readability, maintainability, and scalability.

The system also demonstrates core Java concepts such as OOP principles (inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism), exception handling, collections, and multithreading, along with prepared statements and transaction management in JDBC for secure and efficient database operations.

Overall, the project provides a practical implementation of a real-world web application using Java enterprise technologies and fulfills academic requirements for demonstrating backend development using JDBC, Servlets, and JSP.
